# converter_backend
The backend for converting IFC to various other formats (LBD-RDF, ifcOWL, COLLADA, GLTF)

You need to have both Node.js installed (running the backend) and Java (running some subprocesses/converters).

* "npm install" is required to install the necessary packages after synchronising
* "npm run start" gets it up and running.
